      Last weekend, over 50 volunteers gathered along the riverside to participate in the Clean-Up Drive organized by GreenAction. Armed with gloves and reusable bags, they managed to collect more than 75 kg of waste, consisting mostly of plastic bottles, food wrappers, and discarded clothes.

      The event was not only about cleaning but also about educating the local community about proper waste management. "It was heartwarming to see families and young people working together for a greener environment," said event coordinator Rina Aditya.

      This is part of a larger monthly effort by the NGO to tackle pollution and raise awareness on environmental sustainability. Volunteers will reconvene next month in a new location.

      Stay tuned for more clean-up efforts and learn how you can be a part of it!

      The pilot program for Smart Bins was officially launched yesterday, with installations placed in two high-traffic areas: BINUS Campus and Central Mall. These bins use AI and sensors to automatically sort recyclables and organic waste.

      According to EcoTech's project manager, the goal is to improve waste segregation and reduce landfill waste by 30% in the first three months. Users are guided with a visual display on what goes where, making the process intuitive and fun.

      Early feedback from students and mall-goers has been overwhelmingly positive. “I used to get confused where to throw my cups or boxes. Now the bin helps me,” said one student at BINUS.

      If the pilot is successful, the program will expand to public parks and schools in the coming year.
